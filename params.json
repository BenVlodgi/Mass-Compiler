{"name":"Mass-compiler","tagline":"Compile one, compile them all","body":"##Mass-Compiler\r\n\r\n##### What is it?\r\nA utility which can compiler multiple maps (vmfs) sequentially with no user input necessary after starting.\r\n\r\n##### Why would I need this?\r\nIf you are maintaining a campaign of maps, this is extremely helpful. Whether it is a mappack, a mod, or a full game, if you change assets for your campaign and need to recompile all your maps, this tool can make it as easy as one click. Perhaps you've been working on your campaign for a long time, and are now ready to compile all your maps on the final settings, instead of opening each map individually in Hammer and running the map....waiting a few hours for it to finish and repeating that for every map in your campaign, simply run the mass-compiler.\r\n\r\n##### To set up a configuration file\r\n\r\n- Run CompilerConfigurer.exe \r\n- Press [Detect]\r\n- Open your compiler of choice (hammer)\r\n- Run your fav compile configuration\r\n- Watch the Detect screen as it populates with your params, feel free to close compiler now\r\n- Checkbox the configs you want to keep\r\n- Press [OK]\r\n- In the parameter boxes, replace the map \"filepath\\filename\" with \"{0}\", make sure the {0} is wrapped in \"quotation marks\"\r\n- Press [Save]\r\n\r\n##### To compile maps\r\n\r\n- Create a shortcut to the MassCompiler.exe or use the exe directly\r\n- Drag the map(s) you want to compile onto the MassCompiler shortcut or exe\r\nOR\r\n- Create a text file with the extension .vmflst and on each line give the full absolute path to the vmf file. A file of this exact format is produced on every compile in the executing directory\r\n- Drag this onto the MassCompiler.exe to compile each file on the list.\r\n","google":"UA-54278248-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
